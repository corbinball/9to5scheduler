# 9to5scheduler

Unfinished hw, for the second time.
Will have to resubmit. 

I started off on the wrong foot trying to make my html use table elements.
Spent 4 days trying to make table, tr, th, td, and tbody elements work.
Then on friday scarapped all that and started over after formatting issues.
Just used divs and fixed formatting.

once that was working started working with my javascript functions.
got my currentdate at top of page working.
attempted to get localstorages to work.
issues with set items and get items.
Will return to this.
